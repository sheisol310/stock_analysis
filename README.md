# Stock Analysis 
By running program on python, we get several charts and some numbers to help us perform both fundamental and technical analysis to determine if this stock is good to buy or sell now. In this report, we chose DIS (Walt Disney Company) to analyze.

# Conclusion
Although P / S and SMA gave us bad signals not to buy DIS, we believe now is still good to buy DIS for two reasons. One is that we got pretty good signals on RSI and VWAP, where they both indicated DIS may have a chance to bounce back. Moreover, we got a fair price of DIS by inputting DCF is higher than the current price. The other one is that Disney+ just recently launched in Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong, so we can expect the current 118 million total subscribers to grow and gradually catch to Netflix (215 million total subscribers). DIS may grow slow in the following months, but with the undervalued price of 146, we recommend everyone to buy some shares at this time and wait for it to bounce back, and then it may raise its price steadily as the strikes of pandemic gradually gets eased.
