# Stock Analysis 

By running program on python, we get several charts and some numbers to help us perform both fundamental and technical analysis to determine if this stock is good to buy or sell now. In this report, we chose DIS (Walt Disney Company) to analyze.  [Report](https://github.com/sheisol310/technical_analysis/blob/main/Report%20of%20Analysis.pdf)
